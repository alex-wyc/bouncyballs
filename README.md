bouncyballs!!!

Jonny So, Yicheng Wang

As the name suggests, the project is one of bouncy balls written using svg and
js! The screen starts off with 10 balls of different size, color and velocities, they bounce off the wall
and each other. The user can add more balls by clicking on empty space on the
svg, where a ball of random size, color and velocity will spawn on the spot of
clicking. The user can also delete balls by clicking on them. The project also
logs total momentum and kinetic energy of the system in the console.
